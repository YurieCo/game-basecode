Very brief usage information.


rsedit, RetroSprite Edit

    Used to assemble animations from a spritesheet, and save an .rs-file that
    that can be later used with retrosprite.[ch]

    Usage:

        ./rsedit spritesheet.png spritewidth spriteheight

        Load existing rsfile:

        ./rsedit spritesheet.png spritewidth spriteheight rsfile.rs

    Limitations:

        The spritesheet must be dimensioned in the power of two, and it must be
        square.

        The spritewidth/height must be in the power of two.  The editor may not 
        work properly unless the dimensions are square, but that's a limitation
        in the editor - not in retrosprite.[ch].  Feel free to supply a patch,
        if you want to.  :)

        The saved file is always named 'out.rs', so make sure to copy it to
        whatever you wanna call it.



rtsedit, Retro TileSet Edit

    Used to assemble tile animations from a tileset, and save a .rts-file that
    can be later used with retroworld.[ch]

        ./rtsedit tilesheet.png tilewidth tileheight rtsfile.rts

    Limitations:

rtmedit, Retro TileMap Edit

    Used to assemble a tilemap from a tileset, and save a .rtm-file that can be
    later used with retroworld.[ch].
